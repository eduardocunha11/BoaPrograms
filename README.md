# Boa Programs for Detection of Bug Fix Patterns 

Pan et al. [1] identified 27 bug fix patterns through manual inspection of the bug fix change history of seven open-source Java projects. They found that the most common categories of bug fix patterns are: Method Call and IF-related. 

We released our Boa programs designed to detect common bug fix patterns in the history information of the project.
We created Boa programs for the five bug fix patterns listed below (for more information, please refer to Pan et al. work [1]):

# Common Bug Fix Patterns

- Change of IF Condition Expression (IF-CC) <br>
- Method Call with different actual parameter values (MC-DAP) <br>
- Method Call with different number of parameters (MC-DNP) <br>
- Change of Assignment Expression (AS-CE) <br>
- Addition of Precondition Check (IF-APC) <br>
